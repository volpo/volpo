### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

During my time at university I learned different programming languages â€‹â€‹and that led me to become more interested in work focused on data and its analysis. In 2023 I started my career in data science and am currently looking to land my first related job. I have developed and participated in data projects and I am currently continuing to improve myself. I am currently studying a technical degree in software development.
